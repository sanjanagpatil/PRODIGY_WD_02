🕒 Stylish Stopwatch Web Application
Modern Web-Based Stopwatch with Lap Tracking, Designed Using Glassmorphism UI Principles
📌 Overview
This is a fully interactive and visually modern stopwatch application created using the fundamental web stack — HTML5, CSS3, and ES6-based JavaScript. It features a minimal yet futuristic interface inspired by glassmorphism and neon-glow UI design patterns. The application supports Start, Pause, Reset, and Lap tracking with real-time updates and user interaction handling.

This project serves as a front-end UI/UX and logic-building exercise for developers aiming to create responsive, elegant, and functional single-page web applications without any external frameworks.

🔍 Project Objective
To build a fully responsive stopwatch with lap support and an animated UI that merges modern visual design with accurate time-tracking functionality using only front-end technologies.

🛠️ Step-by-Step Implementation Breakdown
1️⃣ HTML Markup – Structural Foundation
File: index.html

Role: Defines the DOM structure

Highlights:

Uses semantic tags (<h1>, <div>, <ul>)

Links to external CSS and JavaScript files

Loads custom Google Font: Rajdhani for digital-style display

Contains:

A timer display (#display)

Interactive buttons (#startStop, #lap, #reset)

A container for lap entries (#laps)

2️⃣ CSS Design – Advanced Glassmorphism & Responsiveness
File: style.css

Styling techniques used:

Glassmorphism:

backdrop-filter: blur(12px)

Semi-transparent layers with rgba()

Soft inner shadows and borders

Neon Effects:

text-shadow, box-shadow for glowing UI

Dynamic button states on hover

Responsiveness:

flexbox layout adapts to screen sizes

Custom spacing, padding, and scalable font sizes

Accessibility:

High contrast color choices

Consistent button sizes and spacing

3️⃣ JavaScript Logic – Time Management & State Handling
File: script.js

Main functionalities:

Timer tracking via Date.now() and setInterval()

UI state control using boolean flags (e.g. isRunning)

Time difference calculation ensures resume support

Millisecond-level display update with custom formatting

Core Modules:

startTimer() – Starts/resumes stopwatch

pauseTimer() – Pauses without resetting time

resetTimer() – Resets time and clears laps

recordLap() – Saves current time snapshot to lap list

updateDisplay() – Refreshes UI in real time

pad() and padMs() – Pads time units for consistent formatting

UX Enhancements:

Laps are dynamically appended as <li> elements

Each lap includes a delete (✖) button for removal
